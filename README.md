# JavaExercise16.17ColorSelecterUsingSlider
This program is meant to use javaFX to change the color of a line of text based on the slider value using listeners to help track when the sliders get altered.
Also this program was developed in intellij to try out a couple IDEs to figure out which I prefer for javaFX use, this might be the only submission using intellij.
To get to the main file itself you want to go from the folder ColorSelectorUsingSliders => src/main => java/com/example/colorselectorusingsliders=> and then open the HelloApplication.java file
